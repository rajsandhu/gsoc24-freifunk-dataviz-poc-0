A proof-of-concept for a possible GSoC24 project.

In its current iteration, it's a python script that ingests Freifunk JSON files from their web repository and then performs some very simple data exploration.

For now, to see functional files, ignore the ones with "influxdb" in their names because they're just placefolders until I grok influxDB or at least get it working here.

*directions:*

- install python
- make a .env file for "sum_freifunk_nodes_v0.py"
- run the file "sum_freifunk_nodes_v0.py"

*background:*

Before this repo, I prototyped in Google Colab:
