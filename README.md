A proof-of-concept for a possible GSoC24 project.

It's a python script that ingests Freifunk JSON files and does some very simple data exploration and summary statistics.

For now, to see functional files, ignore the ones with "influxdb" in their names because they're just placefolders until I grok influxDB or at least get it working here.

*directions:*

- install python
- make a .env file for "sum_freifunk_nodes_influxdb_v0.py"
- run the file "sum_freifunk_nodes_v0.py"

*background:*

Before this repo, I prototyped in Google Colab:
